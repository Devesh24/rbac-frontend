## Description

The Interface basically has three types of users - `Students`, `Faculties` and `Admin`.

A `Student` can login in the interface and can view his/her profile.

An `Admin` can login and can access all the special functionalities such as Add/Delete/Update/View Users, Faculties and Students
Also, the admin has the power to provide `permissions` to a specific user(faculty), so that he can access some of the functionalities that the admin has, such as Update/View Students, faculties.
The permissions can be given by admin using the `update user` option in `get all users` section.

A `Faculty` can only login if he/she has `permissions` given by the admin and also can only login using the credentials created and provided by admin.
